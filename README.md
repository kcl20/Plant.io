# Project 3: Plant.io

## Description

Plant.io is an application that allows plant lovers and gardening enthusiasts to be part of a community and share their experiences with growing and maintaining their favourite plants. On the homepage of the site, the user can browse existing profiles. Users can create an account to upload pics of their plants along with the plant's care requirements. Once signed up, users will have access to their dashboard which only shows their own plants. From the dashboard, they can update or edit existing plant profiles. Clicking on a plant profile will provide an image of the plant and details on plant care requirements such as watering, sun exposure, humidity and temperature. Keep your plants alive with Plant.io!
